- [SteamWorld: Heist](http://steamworldgames.com/heist/) — Upcoming sequel to [SteamWorld: Dig](http://steamworldgames.com/dig/). We're sweating away trying to make this a worthy follow-up.
- [Fingu](http://ipkl.gu.se/english/Research/research_projects/codac/fingu) — Another existing game I've worked with updating. Interesting educational product teaching small children count.
- [SteamWorld: Dig](http://steamworldgames.com/dig/) — The game that really put [Image & Form](http://www.imageform.se) on the map as an indie game developer. Proud to have worked on this game.
- [Anthill](http://anthillgame.com/) — Worked on two expansions for this neat little iOS game, our gem with a million copies sold.
- [Hugo Troll Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Troll_Race) — Worked a couple of months on the back end of this project. Did not do that much, but worked as a great introduction to our internal framework.
- [Colosseum: Hammerball](http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Colosseum-Hammerball/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025855032c) — Super fun summer project, made with XNA. Still out on [XLIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live_Indie_Games).
- [Split Trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_6xE0_5rQc) — Another school project, this one made with the Unreal development kit. Lead as well.
- [Alcheringa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq38Byuvdeg) — A fun school project I think about remaking from time to time. Lead developer.
