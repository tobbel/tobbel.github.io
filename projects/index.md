- [SteamWorld: Heist](http://imageform.se/game/steamworld-heist/) — Lauded sequel to [SteamWorld: Dig](http://steamworldgames.com/dig/). Worked on this the majority of development, unfortunately left Image & Form a few months before completion.
- [Fingu](http://ipkl.gu.se/english/Research/research_projects/codac/fingu) — Another existing game I've worked with updating. Interesting educational product teaching small children how to count.
- [SteamWorld: Dig](http://imageform.se/game/steamworld-dig/) — The game that really put [Image & Form](http://www.imageform.se) on the map as an indie game developer. Proud to have worked on this game.
- [Anthill](http://anthillgame.com/) — Worked on two expansions for this neat little iOS game, our gem with a million copies sold.
- [Hugo Troll Race](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Troll_Race)(Original iOS version) — Worked a couple of months on the back end of this project. Did not do that much, but worked as a great introduction to our internal framework.
- Colosseum: Hammerball — Super fun summer project, made with XNA. Unfortunately since [XLIG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live_Indie_Games) shut down, it's no longer available. There's a few [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIerxyBsDn4) of it being played out there.
- [Split Trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_6xE0_5rQc) — Another school project, this one made with the Unreal development kit. Lead as well.
- [Alcheringa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq38Byuvdeg) — A fun school project I think about remaking from time to time. Lead developer.
