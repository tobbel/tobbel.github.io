Hi! My name is Tobias Lilja and I'm a developer living and working in Lule√•, Sweden. I'm currently working with the local [healthcare authority](http://www.norrbotten.se) developing internal apps and services, as well as some database administration. I've also worked in game development, including with:
[Shortfuse Games](http://www.shortfuse.se) and
[Image & Form](http://www.imageform.se).
I worked a brief stint in the maritime industry, making a GUI for the fire alarm system developed by [Consilium](http://www.consilium.se).
